The coder successfully understand how to use the twitter api, ffmpeg, and Google api.
The code runs successfully and does a great job meeting the goals of the miniproject.
The code contains a module of error checking which I think is a flashing point of the project.
However, the process for the code review is not so friendly. For each reviewer, the local path should be typed in manually by hands. 
And the Google api credentials json file should be runned before the code, which I think is a waste of users' time. The credential module 
should be integrated in the code.
And the interface of the code running is not quite clear. The user may not understand what the computer is doing when the code runs.
There should be a feedback output to the screen to explain what the function is doing at the same time, in order to meet the needs of users.
